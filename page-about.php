			<h3>How does this work?</h3>
			<span>This is a fun and free online course that's conducted entirely in the medium of video. You will have access to free tools to create and share political remix videos. 
			<br><br>
 			Each week, we'll email you with video episodes exploring that week's theme. Then you'll learn to make a video, share it with the community, and join the discussion on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23spintimetv">#spintimetv</a>. 
			<br><br>
 			Sound interesting? <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/join">Sign up</a> and we'll get started on September 26th.</span>

			<h3>What will I learn about the election and presidential politics?</h3>

			<span>We'll explore six themes: television & debates, comparative news & bias, attack ads, social media, the spin cycle, infotainment & comedy in politics. You will directly engage with these themes by making videos—in real-time, along with the current news cycle—using our easy web-based tools.</span>

			<h3>What will I make?</h3>
			<span>We built a free and fun-to-use <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/resources">video editor</a> that lets you remix all of television news and YouTube. You'll learn how to make supercuts, video essays, animated GIFs and viral videos that will challenge your creativity and help you express your point of view on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.</span>

			<h3>What is the time commitment?</h3>
			<span>For most people, this will be about a 1-2 hour weekly commitment until election day. On an average week you will watch 10 minutes of short, highly shareable course videos and spend at least an hour creating a short video. But you can flexibly participate in the way that makes sense to you.</span>

			<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
			<span>This course is appropriate for anyone with an interest in politics and the news media. We anticipate participation from students in media studies, bloggers and journalists, creative media-makers, historians, researchers, and others. 

			You should join if you are interested in exploring election 2016 topics in a fun, collaborative community—you’ll have many opportunities to show off your creativity and express yourself by creating and sharing video.</span>

			<h3>Do I need to know anything going in?</h3>
			<span>Familiarity with the American political system and some experience with video would be helpful, but not necessary. You’ll need a computer with a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox or Safari and be comfortable participating in an online community.</span>

			<h3>When does it take place?</h3>
			<span>The course will begin on September 26th, and conclude November 11th—right after Election Day 2016. See the <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/syllabus">full schedule</a>.</span>

			<h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
			<span><a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/join">Please fill out the form here</a> and we’ll be in touch.</span>

			<h3>Is this a credit-granting course?</h3>
			<span>No—but it has been designed to be as accessible and flexible as possible so that people can freely participate.</span>

			<h3>Is this a partisan or political event?</h3>
			<span>No. Participants in this community will represent a range of political views and political affiliations. Although people are welcome to share their personal perspectives, Spin Time TV is not about advocacy or specific political issues. It's about collaboratively deconstruting and understanding the media.</span>

			<span>Our goal is to create a fun, irreverent, and respectful community where people can share perspectives on TV news, political media, and this election in general. For more, please see our <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/welcome#conduct">community standards</a>.  </span>

			<h3>Who made this?</h3>

			<span>Spin Time TV is built by a community of volunteers who are passionate about politics, media-making and media literacy.  <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/credits">Learn more about us</a>.  </span>

			<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
			<span>In election year 1960, two American presidential candidates squared off in the first ever nationally televised presidential debate. Over half a century later, we are now living through an election cycle shaped by reality TV, social media and internet video.</span>
			<br>
			<br>

			With more than 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, it’s clear the moving image has joined print as a primary element of our daily communication. Video is now a part of human language. At the same time that political discourse has become more participatory through the web,  video remains a relatively one-way conversation.
			<br>
			<br>
			Politics is an art which takes place largely through the exchange of written and spoken words. These days, most of us receive these messages through video—whether that's TV news, cable or YouTube. But thanks to the internet, we don’t need to be passive viewers of video. We can now deconstruct, reconstruct, and create video to discover and question political messages and rhetoric. This course is about exploring new possibilities for greater media literacy and self-expression through video.</span>
			<br>
			<h3>I’m an educator. Can I get my students involved?</h3>
			<span>Yes! We encourage educators, afterschool program leaders, clubs, and other associations to enroll people and facilitate local sessions. Our activities and tools are all open source and ready-made programming for media literacy and civics classes. Get in touch and let’s discuss how we can work together and support you. We also have a kit you can use to run Spin Time activities in your local context. Learn more <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/educators">here</a>.</span>

			<h3>How can I pitch in?</h3>
			<span>Spin Time TV is an entirely volunteer-led effort. We'd love for you to join us. We can use the following kinds of help:</span><br>
			<ul>
				<li>spreading the word</li>
				<li>facilitation/moderation</li>
				<li>club leaders</li>
