			<h3>How does this work?</h3>
			<span>This is a fun online course that's conducted entirely in the medium of video. You will have access to video lectures as well as free video production tools to create and share video responses.</span>

			<h3>What is the time commitment?</h3>
			<span>For most people, this will be a 1-2 hour weekly commitment. On an average week you will watch 10 minutes of short, highly shareable lectures and spend at least an hour creating a short video.</span>

			<h3>What will I make?</h3>
			<span>You'll learn how to make supercuts, video essays, animated GIFs and viral videos that will challenge your creativity and help you express your point of view on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.</span>

			<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
			<span>This course is appropriate for anyone with an interest in politics and the news media. We anticipate participation from students in media studies, bloggers and journalists, creative media-makers, historians, researchers, and others. 

			You should join if you are interested in exploring Election 2016 topics in a fun, collaborative community—you’ll have many opportunities to show off your creativity and express yourself by creating and sharing video.</span>

			<h3>Do I need to know anything going in?</h3>
			<span>Familiarity with the American political system and some experience with video would be helpful, but not necessary. You’ll need a computer with a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox or Safari and be comfortable participating in an online community.</span>

			<h3>When does it take place?</h3>
			<span>The course will begin on September 12th, and conclude November 11th—right after Election Day 2016. </span>

			<h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
			<span><a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/join" >Please fill out the form here</a> and we’ll be in touch.</span>

			<h3>How many spots are there?</h3>
			<span>We can accommodate 300 participants. First-come, first served.</span>

			<h3>Is this a credit granting course?</h3>
			<span>No—this is a light-commitment designed to be accessible and flexible to a large number of people. However, we can offer a credential of completion through the OpenBadge system.</span>

			<h3>What will I learn about the election and presidential politics?</h3>

			<span>The syllabus works through topics in the political economy of media. The online activities are part of a very light coursework that will help you develop a media literacy & media deconstruction perspective, by engaging with things that are current in the news cycle.</span>

			<h3>Is this a partisan or political event?</h3>
			<span>No. Participants in this community will represent a range of political views and political affiliations. Although people are welcome to share their personal perspectives, Super News Time is not about advocacy or specific political issues. It's about collaboratively deconstruting and understanding the media.</span>

			<span>Our goal is to create a fun, irreverent, and respectful community where people can share perspectives on TV news, political media, and this election in general. For more, please see our <a href="#">community standards</a>.  </span>

			<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
			<span>In election year 1960, two American presidential candidates participated in the first ever live televised debate. Over half a century later, we are now living through an election cycle shaped by reality TV, social media and internet video.

			With more than 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, it’s clear the moving image has joined print as a primary element of our daily communication. Video is now a part of human language. At the same time that political discourse has become more participatory through the web, web video remains a relatively one-way, consumptive medium.</span>

			<h3>I’m an educator. Can I get my students involved?</h3>
			<span>Yes! We encourage educators, afterschool program leaders, clubs, and other associations to enroll people and facilitate local sessions and clubs. Our activities and tools are all open source and ready-made programming for media literacy classes. Get in touch and let’s discuss how we can work together and support you. We also have a kit you can use to run a local club. Learn more <a href="#">here</a>.</span>

			<h3>How can I pitch in?</h3>
			<span>We can use the following kinds of help:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>facilitation/moderation</li>
				<li>club leaders</li>
				<li>tech help</li>
				<li>video help</li>
				<li>transcription help</li>
				<li>spreading the word</li>
			</ul>
